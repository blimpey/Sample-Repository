    There's a tiny door in that empty  office. It's a portal, Maxine. It  takes you inside John Malkovich.  You see the world through John
		    Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey  Turnpike.
        
# Who is John Malkovich?

 # He's been in lots of things.
	
	He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived  it. There's only one thing to do.
